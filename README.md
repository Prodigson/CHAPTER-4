# CHAPTER-4

#Creating a Starter Project Template

In this chapter, I learned how to create the starter project that can use for all future apps in this book. Create folders with the mkdir command and named them accordingly to group the logic. Also create two Dart files: main.dart for the main() function that starts the app and home.dart to contain the code for the Home widget. Before starting developing an app, it’s important to create your structure; like when building a house, the foundation is created first. Structuring widgets in an organized manner improves the code’s readability and maintainability. When creating a new Flutter project, the software development kit (SDK) does not automatically create the separate home.dart file, which contains the main presentation page when the app starts.
